### How to contribute?

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a branch with a name appropriate to the task, preferably the theme name if you are using adding a custom theme.
3. Commit the changes to that branch in your forked repository.
4. Send a Pull Request and wait for approval/comments.

### Adding your custom theme

1. Add it to the custom themes section similar to how default themes have been added.
2. Make sure the add a screenshot as well following the guidelines the section below.
3. Name your theme as per your wish, add a link to your Github profile beside the theme name in parentheses so every using it is aware of the creator.
4. Refrain from using foul, offensive or indecent language in custom theme names.

### Adding screenshots for existing themes - make sure to follow these guidelines:

1. Make sure the screenshot size is small so that users with slow internet connection can open this README without much hassle.
2. Most importantly the text in the screenshot should be decent and not be offensive in any way. Such screenshots will not pass PR approval.
3. Add the screenshots under `assets/images/` folder where the name of the screenshot should be the name of the theme. e.g. The screenshot for aubergine should be aubergine.jpg or aubergine.png or any other extension that works best. For theme names with multiple words use hyphenated strings e.g. choco-mint
4. Add a collapsible section with message `Click to see screenshot` under each hex code and add the screenshot inside the collapsible section. This should be done so that all collapsible sections are closed whenever a user opens the README and is able to scroll through easily without having to see all screenshots.
